===Use Case 5: Repair Metadata===

*Scope:* DeDupester application

*Level:* user goal

*Primary Actor:* User

*Stakeholders and Interests:*
 _User:_ Wants to repair metadata in their music library.
 
*Preconditions:* Library has consistent folder structure and filenames based on artist, album, and track names or numbers.

*Main Success Scenario:*
  # User launches DeDupester application and chooses to [RepairMetadata Repair Metadata].
  # Application prompts for location of library.
  # User enters library location.
  # Application scans library for missing or corrupt metadata and presents user with its best guess for corrections.
  # User reviews suggestions and chooses to continue with repair.
  # Application prompts user for destination location where repaired files should be written.
  # User enters location for repaired library to be written.
  # Application successfully repairs metadata within the library.

*Open Issues:*

Don't allow if any required information is missing (i.e. metadata cannot be inferred from folder/filenames).  Notify user of unsupported file types.  What about backup options?  What is corrupt metadata considered to be?
