#summary Organize Library use case.

===Use Case 5: Organize Library===

*Scope:* DeDupester application

*Level:* user goal

*Primary Actor:* User

*Stakeholders and Interests:*
 _User:_ Wants to organize their music library in a consistent way according to file metadata.

*Preconditions:* Library has complete and correct metadata.

*Main Success Scenario:*
  # User launches DeDupester application and chooses to [OrganizeLibrary Organize Library].
  # Application prompts for location of library.
  # User enters library location.
  # Application prompts user for organization scheme (e.g. Folders named after Artist - Album, files named by Track Number - Album Name - Track Title).
  # User enters organization scheme.
  # Application presents preview of organization results.
  # User accepts.
  # Application prompts user for destination location where organized files should be written.
  # User enters location for organized library to be written.
  # Application successfully organizes library.

*Open Issues:*

Don't allow if any required metadata is missing.  Notify user if unsupported file types may leave orphan tracks (i.e. some tracks in an album will be moved/renamed and others will not)?  Backup options (only by selecting a different destination)?
